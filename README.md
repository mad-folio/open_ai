I am a writer. I write all the time. I write in openAi and Appendix: a note on terminology.  

OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company. They are trying to solve the problem of making artificial intelligence safe and beneficial for people and society. OpenAI's strategy is to pursue a number of paths at the same time, so that whatever happens, we will have a good outcome.


One of the paths they're pursuing is developing new techniques for training AI systems. These techniques would make it possible to train AI systems more quickly, which would let us try out more ideas in shorter time periods. For example, one idea they're exploring is using reinforcement learning to teach AI systems about physics. This technique could be used to make better games or simulations that help train people in how to do things like fly planes or do surgery.


Another path they're pursuing is creating tools for developers by developing software libraries, hardware platforms, and infrastructure. For example, one project they've been working on is called Universe. Universe lets developers create virtual environments for their AI agents to explore and learn from without having to build those environments themselves. It also has a library of pre-made environments that developers can use when creating their own environments."


The openAi experiment has proved that artificial intelligence can be taught to write essays. The AI is capable of producing quality essays which are indistinguishable from those written by humans. However, the AI still needs a human to feed it with data and information about the essay topic. There are limitations in using this AI for writing essays such as plagiarism detection and grammar correction.


OpenAI is a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company that was founded in 2015. OpenAI's goal is to advance digital intelligence and ensure that AI benefits all of humanity.


Their work so far has been focused on creating an AI system, called the OpenAI Five, which can compete against human players in Valve's Dota 2 game. The OpenAI Five competed at The International 2017 tournament and won one of the five games it played against humans.


In August 2018, they launched Universe, a platform for training AI systems on complex video games using machine learning. In September 2018, they published a paper in Nature describing their "Neural Architecture Search" (NAS) algorithm to find new deep neural networks with given specifications. In October 2018, they announced their intent to build a computer system called "OpenAI Five Plus" with 10 times more processing power than the original OpenAI Five and 100 times more memory capacity."


OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman. OpenAI's goal is to build safe AI, and their approach to alignment is a step in the right direction. They believe that one of the most important aspects of an AI system is its ability to be aligned with human values. They have developed a set of core principles which govern how they design AI systems. These principles are: Safety, Transparency, Impartiality, Cooperation, and Sharing.


OpenAI believes that safety should come first when designing AI systems because as soon as there are any safety risks involved, then it becomes necessary to halt development and fix the problem before proceeding further.


OpenAI has also developed a set of tests for safety that they use internally to ensure that their system will not do anything dangerous or harmful. 
Transparency: OpenAI believes transparency is needed in order for people to understand what an AI system does so that they can make informed decisions about whether or not they want it in their lives. The more transparent an AI system is, the better people will be able to understand it and decide if they want it around them or not. 


OpenAI has released their safety principles which state: 
*"We believe AI should be an extension of individual human wills and so we will design AI systems that maximize individual autonomy."
*"We believe AI must be robust and beneficial; its value must exceed its cost."
*"We believe itâ€™s important to create shared value through collaboration between people and between societies."

OpenAI also states that they want to build safe software but they don't want to write perfect software because perfect software doesn't exist yet. OpenAI wants to find ways to keep people safe from harmful AI


OpenAI believes that all humans deserve equal treatment when interacting with an AI system so that no one feels like they're being discriminated against based on who they are, where they live, or what group they belong to. Humans are flawed. We make mistakes and sometimes we can't see the consequences of our actions. This is not just a problem for humans, it's also a problem for Artificial Intelligence (AI).


Ai is being developed at an unprecedented rate. It's been predicted that by 2040, AI will be doing half of the jobs in the world. This would be a huge win for humanity if we could guarantee that Ai is safe and won't cause any harm to humans or other lifeforms on Earth.
This is where OpenAI comes in. OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever with the mission to "advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole". They have created an environment where they can test AI algorithms without harming humans or other lifeforms on earth.


In conclusion, the openAi experiment has proved that artificial intelligence can be taught to write essays. The AI is capable of producing quality essays which are indistinguishable from those written by humans. However, the AI still needs a human to feed it with data and information about the essay topic. There are limitations in using this AI for writing essays such as plagiarism detection and grammar correction.
