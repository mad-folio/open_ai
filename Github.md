## 1. Introduction

Github is a website that allows developers to upload their code and collaborate on projects. It is a site for programmers, designers, artists, and other people who make things. Github was created in 2008 and has grown exponentially since then. It has more than 20 million users, 100 million repositories, and over 1.3 billion pull requests.

The first thing you have to do when you want to use Github is create an account with your email address or username as the username that will be used on github along with a password of your choice. You can also choose whether or not you want to set up two-factor authentication which will generate an SMS message every time someone tries to log into your account from an unrecognized computer or device using the mobile app Authy which makes it more difficult for hackers to access your account without having knowledge of your phone number or email address associated with the account being hacked into. Once you have completed these steps you will be taken to the dashboard where you can see various statistics about your activity on GitHub such as how many followers you have (if any) and how many repositories are under your name if you
 

 
## 2. Why React?

Github is a website that allows people to share and work on code together. It is also a company, which was founded in 2008. The founder of Github, Tom Preston-Werner, had the idea for Github when he was trying to share his code with others but found it difficult because they were not always available. He then created Github so that he could share his code with others and collaborate on projects more easily.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces developed by Facebook in 2013. React is designed to make it easy to create interactive UIs that are fast and efficient. This library can be used as an alternative to other libraries such as AngularJS or EmberJS. React has become popular because it's easier to learn than other libraries, offers better performance than other libraries, and has been adopted by many companies such as Slack and Netflix.
 

 
## 3. Getting Started with React

Github is a platform for hosting software development projects. It provides version control, code review, and other tools to help programmers collaborate on code.

The first thing you need to do when using Github is to create an account. The process for creating an account is very easy and can be done in less than five minutes. 
Once you have created your account, the next step is to download the Github Desktop application. This application makes it easier for you to work with Github by allowing you to commit changes, edit files locally, and sync files with the remote repository. 
The third step in getting started with React is installing NodeJS and npm if they are not already installed on your computer. This will allow you to use tools such as webpack which are used in React development.
The final step in getting started with React is installing the latest version of React from NPM then running npm run start . This will allow you to write your first program that uses React by opening up a new window containing a text editor and displaying a “Hello World” message after compiling.
 

 
## 4. Components and Props

Github is a website that many people use to store their code and collaborate with other people. It also has an open source platform for developers to share their work and collaborate. GitHub was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett as a way of sharing computer code.

A component is a piece of software that performs an individual task. A component can be a library, module or plug-in. Components are often used together to create larger programs. Components are usually developed independently from the rest of the program but they need to interact with each other in order for the program to work correctly.

A prop is a property that defines something about how an object should behave when it's rendered on screen. A prop can be anything from its position on screen, color, size or even what type of shape it has.
 

 
## 5. State and Lifecycle

Github is a code sharing and collaboration site. It was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Scott Chacon. The website allows developers to share their code with other developers. To do so, they create repositories on the site. They can then invite others to collaborate with them on the project.

There are three types of repositories that are available on Github: public, private and organization. Public repositories are free for anyone to use and view the contents of the repository. Private repositories require a username and password to access the repository contents. Organization repositories are similar to public repositories but they have more features which allow organizations to manage permissions for users within their organization.

Github also offers an enterprise version called Github Enterprise which features additional security controls for organizations that want more control over who has access to their codebase as well as advanced integrations with third party services such as Active Directory or LDAP servers for authentication purposes.

The State and Lifecycle topic is about how Github handles changes in state or lifecycle events like commits, merges, etc., 
and how it affects data integrity issues in databases (e.g., referential integrity). 
Github uses git which is a distributed revision control system that provides high-level access via commands such as git commit and git push . This enables programmers to work together on projects without ever having to email files or copy files around themselves which could
 

 
## 6. JSX and ES6
JSX

JSX is a JavaScript extension that enables the user to create XML-like tags in their code. It is often used for defining views in React.

ES6

ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6, which is a new version of JavaScript. One of the main features of ES6 is the ability to use arrow functions and classes.
 

 
## 7. Functional Components
Github is a company that provides hosting for software developers. They have a service called Github Pages, which is a web hosting service for Jekyll-authored sites.
Github Pages is a great way to host static sites and blogs without having to spend any money. For example, if you wanted to make your blog public, you would need to pay for web hosting. However, with Github Pages, you can use the GitHub repo of your site as its own web server.

In order to create a new project on Github Pages, you must first create a folder in the root directory of your repo. Then rename the folder's name to "index." After renaming it, add two files: "readme" and "index." The readme file will be the page that displays when someone visits your site on Github; it should contain information about the project and how it works. The index file will be what displays when someone clicks on your site's domain name from Github; it should contain HTML code or content that will display on the website itself.

The most popular type of site created with this method is a blog. To create one of these sites, you would need to go into index.html and replace all the default text with content about yourself or your blog posts that you want people to see when they visit your website."
 

 
## 8. Refs, Event Handlers, and Render Props (Bonus)
Refs, Event Handlers, and Render Props are three different ways of communicating data between React components. Refs allow you to get a reference to a DOM element on the page and manipulate it from within your React component. Event handlers allow you to specify a function that is called when an event occurs on the DOM element. Render props are functions that are called by a React component's render method to provide data that can be used in the component's render method.

Refs
Refs are one of three ways of communicating data between React components. Refs allow you to get a reference to a DOM element on the page and manipulate it from within your React component. This can be done by using ref="someId" in your JSX, where someId is a string or ID that points to the desired DOM element. You can use this ref as an argument for methods like setState() or findDOMNode(). Refs should not be used when there is already another way of getting access to the DOM element, such as through props or context .
Refs should not be used when there is already another way of getting access to the DOM element, such as through props or context . When using refs, you must always keep in mind that they are "live" references and will update whenever changes happen in their corresponding DOM node. For instance, if you have two <div> elements with ids "foo" and "bar", then you could do something
